## Purpose

Prepared to pass the Udacity Front End Nano Degree.

Training for JS mainly as HTML and CSS are provided by Udacity team.

Learning to build and use functions. Use if...else statements.

While aware of the possibility to use native JS to manipulate the DOM, I used jQuery for speed sake to focus on other items.
